            <h3>History</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              The city of Jaipur was founded by King of Amer, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II on November 18, 1727, 
              who ruled from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amer, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the 
              growing population and increasing scarcity of water. Jai Singh consulted several books on architecture and architects 
              while planning the layout of Jaipur. Under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, Jaipur was planned based 
              on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra.
               The construction of the city began in 1726 and took four years to complete the major roads, offices, 
               and palaces. The city was divided into nine blocks, two of which contained the state buildings and palaces, with 
               the remaining seven allotted to the public. Huge ramparts were built, pierced by seven fortified gates.
              During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh I, the city was painted pink to welcome HRH Albert Edward, Prince of Wales
               (who later became King Edward VII, Emperor of India), in 1876. Many of the avenues still 
               remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.

                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="">City Palace</a></h5>
                <p class="card-text">City Palace has stood at the heart of the Old City of Jaipur for nearly three centuries, shortly after Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II decided to relocate his court from the city of Amber. Protected by huge guard walls, the fairy-tale-like structure is still the home of Jaipur's modern-day royal family, and is more extravagant and enchanting than you might imagine.

                  City Palace is more than a sand-colored regal abode—it's a sprawling complex of buildings built around a series of landscaped garden courtyards overlooking Jaipur and Lake Palace. The entire property is a stunning display of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="">Jantar Mantar</a></h5>
                <p class="card-text">At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery—it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.

                  Each of the 20 or so structures at the UNESCO World Heritage Site serves a distinctive purpose. The observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters tall, it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds. </p>

                <p class="card-text">If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, they probably came from Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze). It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows.

                  The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being seen by the public. Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer palace. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="">Amber Fort</a></h5>
                <p class="card-text">Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.

                  Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort. It's decked out with intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. The fort is laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="">Nahargarh Fort</a></h5>
                <p class="card-text">When it comes to sightseeing around Jaipur, the views don't get better than what you'll find at Nahargarh Fort. Also known as Tiger Fort, the nearly 300-year-old fort overlooks the entire city from atop the Aravalli Hills—a prime location for the structure to defend Jaipur against enemies many years ago.

                  More than just a formidable barrier though, this fort also contains Madhavendra Bhawan, a summer destination for royalty. The sumptuous Rajasthani building features a dozen identical boudoirs for the queens, which all connect to the king's suite through mural-filled corridors. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title"><a href="">Jal Mahal</a></h5>
                <p class="card-text">One look at the Jal Mahal, and you might think you're seeing a mirage. The graceful palace seems to float atop the twinkling Man Sagar Lake—a calm sight compared to the rest of the frenzied city.

                  While it appears to have just one story, the Water Palace has four other levels submerged beneath a reservoir. Tourists can't access the site, however, that may change in the future. Rumor has it that entrepreneurs want to convert the decaying space into a luxe restaurant.
                  
                  For now, simply appreciate the beauty of the palace from afar. At night, it's lit up in all its glory, casting a golden, glowing reflection on the water.
